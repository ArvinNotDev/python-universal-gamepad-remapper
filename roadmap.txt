1 => HIDManager()

2 => scan_devices using HIDManager

3 => start_polling using HIDMaager for parsing user selected controller
     details like vendor_id, product_id, hid_path, name, on_data, on_error
     (The Controller object now represents the physical controller.)

4 => mapper = Mapper(controller, controller_type="ps4", emulate_to="x360")
     mapper creates the EmulateX360 object and a HIDWorker.
     (no need to run hid_worker.run() manually, let Mapper manage it.)

5 => Call mapper.start() to begin polling and sending input to the virtual device.

6 => Call mapper.stop() to stop the mapper.
